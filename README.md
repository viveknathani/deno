# deno

Exploring deno on a weekend.

## thoughts

1. Very structured [manual](https://deno.land/manual). 
2. Has good out-of-the-box tooling. Feels very much like Go. 
3. Environment support is not fluid. Requires some work to enable/disable.
4. Better standard library than node, but needs to be fully stable. 
5. Don't see a strong reason to use this over Go for personal hobby projects.
